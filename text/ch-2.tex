\citet{sowa-2000-knowledgerepr} proposed something very important.

In \citep{turing-1948-intelligentmachinery} we/I introduced another important thing.

We/I did other stuff too \citep{turing-1950-computingmachinery}.


Entpropy is a measure for chaos \cite{shannon-1948-entropy}.

Transfer Learning is an important concept \cite{ruder-2019-phdthesis,ruder-2019-transferlearning} which uses deep learning \citep{goodfellow-2016-dlbook}.
